Notes for using user_upload.php

The database user: should have admin privileges in order to create a database table
Table to be created is called ‘userupload’

For example use:

--file users.csv -h -create_table -h localhost -u userupload -p userupload
--file users.csv --create_table -h localhost -u userupload -p userupload
--file users.csv  -h localhost -u userupload -p userupload

If –create-table is issued, the system exits after the table is created.

After the table is created, the user can issue the command to insert.
The program will create a table called ‘userupload’.
